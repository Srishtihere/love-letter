        Hi baby, So it's been a while that we are in a relationship. First of all, I can't thank enough for being a part of my life. My words can't describe my happiness and my feelings I have for you. After a long thought, I decided to code this cute love letter for you. I love you baby &#128149;

        <div class="line">

        So, I think I don't need to say much about our story but It's definitely one of the most funniest and maybe the cringiest love story ever &#128514; But I think that's what makes it so different from others, it was cute, sweet, healthy and very real.

        I still sometimes wonder that what just happend in last 5 months. I still remember I first heard your name from Subhranil and saw your DP and I was like - "Bapre ja ghem thak thak dure thaka e bhalo hbe." then I became a GDSC core team member, and my got distanced further - "Enemy of GDSC". So, I never interacted, never attended any of your sessions, and never saw your social medias. I litrally thought you were even Chaitaly Di's senior. &#128514;

        <div class="line">
        <img src="img6.jpg" id="img6">
        Then the first time we inetracted nothing to say, you were just so cute, To be honest that time not a brotherly vibe but i felt more of a warmth love of a person, a caring and respectful guy, that's what made me become a fan of yours then I won't lie I had a slight crush on you but you mentioned me as 'bunu' and that you were committed.

        <div class="line">
        <img src="img8.jpg" id="img8">
        Then I just came into realizaton that this person is so diffren then others, like to be honest I met many boys, seniors and juniors in my life but you were kind of rare as a person. Your vibe bought me more closer to you that I could easily open up to you. You were like a stranger to me but I was still able to open up to you.

        <div class="line"> 
        <img src="img10.jpg">
        Then the most crucial moment came when you mentioned that you like me, I was so shocked because I'll be very honest one thing I feared the most was losing and after falling out with Prasun who I considered a close friend as well was already verging towards its end, So, somewhat yes I didn't had any feelings for you back then but the thing I feared the most was losing you out of my life.
        <img src="img11.jpg">

        <br> 
        <div class="line">
        <img src="img12.jpg">
        You won't believe this but do you remember when I used to mention that you should not wait for me or their were still chances of having a relationship it was because I feared that you won't give me the same attention, be the same caring with me anymore if somebody else comes in your life. mYbe I was spiking jealousy. Yes, that is the reason I confused you so much &#128514; . But let it be jo hogaya so hogaya

        <div class="line">
        <img src="img14.jpg">
        Now, the only thing I know is that I love you very much, care for you very much, and I don't know what the future holds but I just want you to be their beside me, be that corner where I can express my true self and true emotions. Ok, I am getting emotional writting thi but I really love you idiot and litrally miss you like anything. I just want to be their by your side and cuddle.
